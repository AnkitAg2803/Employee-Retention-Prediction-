# Employee-Retention-Prediction-
ðŸ“Œ Job Change Prediction
Predict whether an employee will switch jobs based on various features such as experience, training hours, education level, and company size.
### This project uses Machine Learning to predict job changes. We preprocess data, handle missing values, apply feature scaling, and use models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and LightGBM to improve accuracy.

Dataset
The dataset contains information on employees, including experience, training hours, company size, and job change status.
It includes both numerical and categorical features.
Target Variable: target (1 = job change, 0 = no job change).

Best Model: LightGBM :- 
 Highest Accuracy (75. 69 %)
